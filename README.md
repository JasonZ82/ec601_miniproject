## Instruction :laughing:

#### Prerequesite and installation :open_mouth:
* In order to run the code, **the OpenCV must be installed on your computer firstly**. 
  
* The team chose the **Windows 10** as the OS, **Visual Studio 2015** as the IDE and utilized the **C++** programming language.
  
* However, the choice of OS and IDE are subject to users, **the users could choose OS and IDE they preferred**.
  
* There are many tutorials available online for installing OpenCV on your computer, the user could find a suitable one and follow the instructions to install OpenCV on computers.

#### Run the code :relieved:
* After installing the OpenCV，the users could **download the modified code from our repository**.
  
* Then, add the code into your project. If the program need a input diagram, the users could download [**Lenna.png**](https://github.com/qinjinjia/ec601_ass1/blob/master/original.png) from our repository and add it into your project folder.
