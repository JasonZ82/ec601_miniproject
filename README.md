## Project Description :bowtie:
:new_moon: The aim :golf: of the project：
       
   * Be familiar with **software code management** using Github
             
   * Practice **Agile software development [(Scrum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))** with a colleague
   
:waxing_crescent_moon: The project is based on    :link:**[OpenCV: Open Source Computer Version library](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)** and utilizing C++ programming language.

:first_quarter_moon: Some samples are picked from the OpenCV **[Samples folder :briefcase:](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples)** in order to conducting the Homework(i.e. practice Pull, Push, Branching, Merging and Conflict resolutions), [create_mask.cpp](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/create_mask.cpp) for instance.
  
:waxing_gibbous_moon: The modification on the code can be found by pressing the **"history"** tab in each C++ file.
       
:full_moon: Here is a **comparison** of the outputs before and after modifying the code:

## Instruction :laughing:

#### Prerequesite and installation :open_mouth:
* In order to run the code, **the OpenCV must be installed on your computer firstly**. 
  
* The team chose the **Windows 10** as the OS, **Visual Studio 2015** as the IDE and utilized the **C++** programming language.
  
* However, the choice of OS and IDE are subject to users, **the users could choose OS and IDE they preferred**.
  
* There are many tutorials available online for installing OpenCV on your computer, the user could find a suitable one and follow the instructions to install OpenCV on computers.

#### Run the code :relieved:
* After installing the OpenCV，the users could **download the modified code from our repository**.
  
* Then, add the code into your project. If the program need a input diagram, the users could download [**Lenna.png**](https://github.com/qinjinjia/ec601_ass1/blob/master/original.png) from our repository and add it into your project folder.
  

#### Enjoy the code and have fun!:wink::wink:
